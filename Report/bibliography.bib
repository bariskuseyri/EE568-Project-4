A second advantage is a higher fault-tolerant capability, making the machine able to work even in faulty conditions. However, the fractional-slot configuration presents a high content of MMF harmonics that may cause an unbalanced saturation and thus an unbearable torque ripple. A method to design fractional-slot machines is illustrated in this paper, including double-layer and single-layer windings. The analytical computation is extended to determine the harmonics of MMF distribution. Their effect is highlighted in isotropic as well as anisotropic machines. Finally, some considerations are reported to avoid unsuitable configurations.},

The design of the single-layer fractionalslot synchronous motors is dealt with, in which each slot contains only one side coil. The star of slots, introduced some time ago, proves itself to be again appropriate. After a brief review of the classical theory of the star of slots, its application is extended to the design of these unconventional windings. Thanks to its graphical representation, a simple analytical formulation is carried out describing the harmonic contents of the winding distribution. Finally, the star of slots allows simple rules for the design of fractional-slot single-layer windings to be determined.

Among the different topologies, the spoke type is an effective configuration when high torque density is required. On the other hand, the motor performance are heavily related to the selected slot-pole combination. This choice is critical in demanding automotive applications, such as electric power steering (EPS) systems, where high constraints in terms of torque density, torque quality, flux weakening performance, and noise/vibration/harshness are requested. This paper deals with the design and analysis of eight optimal slot/pole combinations FSCW IPM spoke type EPS motors. Two different low cost heavy rare earths free PM typologies, ferrite and hot-pressed NdFeB, are considered. A design and optimization procedure based upon the finite element analysis is presented. The impact of the magnetic properties and the slot/pole combination on the optimal motor dimensions, torque density, and motor cost is discussed. Cogging torque, torque ripple, electromechanical performance, and the stator deformation of the machines are evaluated, and the results are compared, highlighting the advantages and the differences among the solutions.},

However, the magnetic field of FSCWs has more space harmonics, including sub-harmonics that lead to undesirable effects. High rotor losses, noise, vibrations and thermal problems are the main drawbacks caused by FSCWs. These disadvantages limit the suitability of this winding type for some applications. In order to improve winding performances, several methods and techniques have recently been developed and analysed. This paper provides an update of latest research activities in terms of optimization of FSCW machines. These include efforts to reduce only sub-harmonics, to simultaneously reduce sub- and high harmonics or to use a higher harmonic for rotor excitation in current-excited synchronous machines. Simplest and most effective methods are considered, and their functionalities are explained briefly. Moreover, the effectiveness of said optimization methods is shown by simulation and experimental results, obtained from various optimized FSCW machines.},

Several prototypes with different thermal management schemes have been built and tested. This paper will cover the test results for all these prototypes and highlight the tradeoffs between the various schemes. Due to the high machine frequency ({$\sim$}1.2 kHz at the top speed), detailed analysis of various loss components and ways to reduce them will be presented.

Building on the contributions of earlier researchers, this paper approaches the problem of torque ripple reduction in IPM machines by applying the principle of mutual harmonics exclusion. First, this paper develops a useful analytical expression for the torque ripple that highlights the stator-rotor harmonic interactions. Next, an analytical design procedure for IPM rotors with multiple flux barriers is proposed that applies the mutual harmonics exclusion principle in combination with stator windings that use odd numbers of slots per pole pair. Finally, the technique is applied to two example IPM machines to investigate the effectiveness of this approach using finite element analysis. Promising results predict that a low peak-to-peak torque ripple can be achieved using relatively small numbers of stator slots and rotor flux barriers for the full range of current control angles, including deep flux weakening.},

Various low-speed high-torque permanent magnet synchronous motors with concentrated windings and with different slot and pole combinations are calculated analytically and by applying the finite element method (Flux2D\texttrademark{} by Cedrat).

After this introduction of principles the main body of the book focuses on the design of a rotating electrical machine. The book defines basic characteristics such as machine type (e.g. synchronous, asynchronous, DC and doubly salient reluctance machines) and type of construction (e.g. external pole, internal pole, axial flux and radial flux machines). It then moves on to provide a detailed analysis of the design process and properties of rotating electrical machines including the insulation and heat removal options. The book illustrates the necessary analytical calculations for machine design through direct design examples i.e. a permanent magnet motor for normal speeds with rotor surface magnets, traditional squirrel cage induction motor, a low speed high torque fractional slot permanent magnet motor etc. "-- "This book is an in-depth essential reference of rotating electrical machine design theory and application"--},

  abstract = {Electrical drive systems, which include electrical machines and power electronics, are a key enabling technology for advanced vehicle propulsion systems that reduce the petroleum dependence of the ground transportation sector. To have significant effect, electric drive technologies must be economical in terms of cost, weight, and size while meeting performance and reliability expectations. Interior permanent magnet machines with fractional-slot concentrated windings have been shown to be good candidates for hybrid traction applications. One of the key challenges is the additional stator magnetomotive force sub- and superharmonic components that lead to higher losses in the rotor as well as saturation effects. This paper tries to address this issue by looking into the concept of stator shifting. The generalized concept of stator shifting in the context of the harmonic components that are targeted for cancellation is presented; the focus is on single-layer and double-layer windings that have stator space subharmonics. It is shown that the stator shifting can reduce the loss-producing harmonics on the rotor as well as help the flux weakening performance of the fractional-slot concentrated winding designs. The cancellation of the loss harmonics is introduced as a method in which a particular harmonic can be targeted as well as reduce the phase inductance of the machine allowing for more room in terms of the operating voltage at higher speed. The concept of stator shifting will be explained, and the effect of varying the shift angle on the various harmonic components and winding factors will be investigated. Various designs, arising out of single-layer and double winding layer 10-pole, 12-slot configuration (targeting the FreedomCAR specifications) with varied shift angles are evaluated. The comparison between these designs in terms of their power density, efficiency, and torque ripple is presented.},

The significance of slot harmonics and the benefits of stators with odd number of slots per pole pair are highlighted. Based on these valuable analytical insights, this paper proposes coordination of the selection of stators with odd number of slots per pole pair and IPM rotors with multiple layers of flux barriers in order to reduce torque ripple. The effectiveness of using stators with odd number of slots per pole pair in reducing torque ripple is validated by applying a finite-element-based Monte Carlo optimization method to four IPM machine topologies, which are combinations of two stator topologies (even or odd number of slots per pole pair) and two IPM rotor topologies (one- or two-layer). It is demonstrated that the torque ripple can be reduced to less than 5\% by selecting a stator with an odd number of slots per pole pair and the IPM rotor with optimized barrier configurations, without using stator/rotor skewing or rotor pole shaping.},

This study performs the general formulation of the winding factor for the fractional-slot concentrated windings. The winding factor is redefined for stator windings without any information of the numbers of poles. For given stator windings, the optimal numbers of poles are determined from the obtained winding factors.

It is found that the average torque of FSCW PMSM is produced by both the principle of conventional PMSM and the magnetic gearing effect. A finite-element analysis (FEA) based equivalent current sheet model and harmonic restoration method is first used in FSCW PM machines with different slot\textendash pole number combinations to quantify the respective contribution of the conventional PMSM and the magnetic gearing effect to the average torque. The influence of slot opening on the magnetic gearing effect, cogging torque, and torque ripple is analyzed. The results show that the magnetic gearing effect makes a nonignorable contribution to the average torque when a large slot opening stator is used. The expression of the gear ratio in FSCW PMSMs is derived. The influence of gear ratio on the contribution of the magnetic gearing effect to the total torque is investigated by FEA. The FEA-predicted torques are validated by experiments on the prototypes.},

Hence, the eccentricity shows the largest influence in machines having 2p = Ns {$\pm$} 1, small influence in machines having 2p = Ns {$\pm$} 2, and the smallest influence in the other machines. The static and rotating eccentricities result in cogging torque components multiples of (2p)th and (Ns)th orders, respectively. Both static and rotating eccentricities produce similar cogging torque magnitude. The experimental results validate the FE and analytical investigation.},

First, the basic winding layout with a 24-slot 14-pole machine to reduce the significant 1st sub-harmonic will be presented for machines with single-layer (SL) windings. From this, a novel double layer (DL) winding layout using the stator-shifting concept will be introduced. By adopting two SL winding sets with a 105\textdegree{} mechanical angle shift with respect to each other, it is not necessary to use overlapping windings. With this configuration, the 1st subharmonic will be completely cancelled and the parasitic 5th harmonic will be significantly reduced. Hence, the rotor losses, specifically magnet loss will be significantly reduced. Finally, two PM machines with different DL winding layout, namely, conventional 12-slot 14-pole and 24-slot 14-pole machine, will be designed and compared to validate the advantages of this winding topology.},
