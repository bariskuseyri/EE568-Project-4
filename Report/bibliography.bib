  abstract = {Nowadays fractional-slot windings are proposed for synchronous motors for different purposes: reduction of end-winding losses, reduction of torque ripple, reduction of mutual coupling among the phases, fault-tolerant applications, and so on. The design of the single-layer fractionalslot synchronous motors is dealt with, in which each slot contains only one side coil. The star of slots, introduced some time ago, proves itself to be again appropriate. After a brief review of the classical theory of the star of slots, its application is extended to the design of these unconventional windings. Thanks to its graphical representation, a simple analytical formulation is carried out describing the harmonic contents of the winding distribution. Finally, the star of slots allows simple rules for the design of fractional-slot single-layer windings to be determined. As a special case, it is used to determine the synchronous motor winding solutions suitable for critical fault-tolerant applications.},

  abstract = {Fractional slot concentrated winding (FSCW) interior permanent magnet (IPM) synchronous motors are nowadays an attractive solution in automotive applications due to their advantages in terms of high performance and manufacturing simplicity. Among the different topologies, the spoke type is an effective configuration when high torque density is required. On the other hand, the motor performance are heavily related to the selected slot-pole combination. This choice is critical in demanding automotive applications, such as electric power steering (EPS) systems, where high constraints in terms of torque density, torque quality, flux weakening performance, and noise/vibration/harshness are requested. This paper deals with the design and analysis of eight optimal slot/pole combinations FSCW IPM spoke type EPS motors. Two different low cost heavy rare earths free PM typologies, ferrite and hot-pressed NdFeB, are considered. A design and optimization procedure based upon the finite element analysis is presented. The impact of the magnetic properties and the slot/pole combination on the optimal motor dimensions, torque density, and motor cost is discussed. Cogging torque, torque ripple, electromechanical performance, and the stator deformation of the machines are evaluated, and the results are compared, highlighting the advantages and the differences among the solutions.},

  abstract = {Usage of fractional slot concentrated windings (FSCWs) in electrical machines offers several advantages due to their simplicity and compactness. However, the magnetic field of FSCWs has more space harmonics, including sub-harmonics that lead to undesirable effects. High rotor losses, noise, vibrations and thermal problems are the main drawbacks caused by FSCWs. These disadvantages limit the suitability of this winding type for some applications. In order to improve winding performances, several methods and techniques have recently been developed and analysed. This paper provides an update of latest research activities in terms of optimization of FSCW machines. These include efforts to reduce only sub-harmonics, to simultaneously reduce sub- and high harmonics or to use a higher harmonic for rotor excitation in current-excited synchronous machines. Simplest and most effective methods are considered, and their functionalities are explained briefly. Moreover, the effectiveness of said optimization methods is shown by simulation and experimental results, obtained from various optimized FSCW machines.},

Building on the contributions of earlier researchers, this paper approaches the problem of torque ripple reduction in IPM machines by applying the principle of mutual harmonics exclusion. First, this paper develops a useful analytical expression for the torque ripple that highlights the stator-rotor harmonic interactions. Next, an analytical design procedure for IPM rotors with multiple flux barriers is proposed that applies the mutual harmonics exclusion principle in combination with stator windings that use odd numbers of slots per pole pair. Finally, the technique is applied to two example IPM machines to investigate the effectiveness of this approach using finite element analysis. Promising results predict that a low peak-to-peak torque ripple can be achieved using relatively small numbers of stator slots and rotor flux barriers for the full range of current control angles, including deep flux weakening.},

To have significant effect, electric drive technologies must be economical in terms of cost, weight, and size while meeting performance and reliability expectations. Interior permanent magnet machines with fractional-slot concentrated windings have been shown to be good candidates for hybrid traction applications. One of the key challenges is the additional stator magnetomotive force sub- and superharmonic components that lead to higher losses in the rotor as well as saturation effects. This paper tries to address this issue by looking into the concept of stator shifting. The generalized concept of stator shifting in the context of the harmonic components that are targeted for cancellation is presented; the focus is on single-layer and double-layer windings that have stator space subharmonics. It is shown that the stator shifting can reduce the loss-producing harmonics on the rotor as well as help the flux weakening performance of the fractional-slot concentrated winding designs. The cancellation of the loss harmonics is introduced as a method in which a particular harmonic can be targeted as well as reduce the phase inductance of the machine allowing for more room in terms of the operating voltage at higher speed. The concept of stator shifting will be explained, and the effect of varying the shift angle on the various harmonic components and winding factors will be investigated. Various designs, arising out of single-layer and double winding layer 10-pole, 12-slot configuration (targeting the FreedomCAR specifications) with varied shift angles are evaluated. The comparison between these designs in terms of their power density, efficiency, and torque ripple is presented.},

  abstract = {This paper develops analytical principles for torque ripple reduction in interior permanent magnet (IPM) synchronous machines. The significance of slot harmonics and the benefits of stators with odd number of slots per pole pair are highlighted. Based on these valuable analytical insights, this paper proposes coordination of the selection of stators with odd number of slots per pole pair and IPM rotors with multiple layers of flux barriers in order to reduce torque ripple. The effectiveness of using stators with odd number of slots per pole pair in reducing torque ripple is validated by applying a finite-element-based Monte Carlo optimization method to four IPM machine topologies, which are combinations of two stator topologies (even or odd number of slots per pole pair) and two IPM rotor topologies (one- or two-layer). It is demonstrated that the torque ripple can be reduced to less than 5\% by selecting a stator with an odd number of slots per pole pair and the IPM rotor with optimized barrier configurations, without using stator/rotor skewing or rotor pole shaping.},

For the design of the winding configurations, many design parameters must be determined. The winding factor provides a useful index for the optimal design. However, no general expressions of the winding factor have been derived for all the winding configurations. This study performs the general formulation of the winding factor for the fractional-slot concentrated windings. The winding factor is redefined for stator windings without any information of the numbers of poles. For given stator windings, the optimal numbers of poles are determined from the obtained winding factors. The design strategy for the winding configurations is validated through a finite element method analysis.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the torque production of fractional-slot concentrated-winding (FSCW) permanentmagnet synchronous machines (PMSMs) is analyzed from the perspective of the air-gap field harmonics modulation accounting for slotting effect. It is found that the average torque of FSCW PMSM is produced by both the principle of conventional PMSM and the magnetic gearing effect. A finite-element analysis (FEA) based equivalent current sheet model and harmonic restoration method is first used in FSCW PM machines with different slot\textendash pole number combinations to quantify the respective contribution of the conventional PMSM and the magnetic gearing effect to the average torque. The influence of slot opening on the magnetic gearing effect, cogging torque, and torque ripple is analyzed. The results show that the magnetic gearing effect makes a nonignorable contribution to the average torque when a large slot opening stator is used. The expression of the gear ratio in FSCW PMSMs is derived. The influence of gear ratio on the contribution of the magnetic gearing effect to the total torque is investigated by FEA. The FEA-predicted torques are validated by experiments on the prototypes.},

A simple factor, which is proportional to the slot number and the pole number and inversely proportional to their smallest common multiple, has been introduced to indicate the ``goodness'' of the slot and pole number combination. In general, the higher the ``goodness'' factor the larger the cogging torque.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel winding layout for the electric machines with fractional-slot concentrated windings (FSCW) using a stator shifting concept, with which all the non-working harmonics can be completely cancelled or significantly reduced and the non-overlapping winding can be kept. First, the basic winding layout with a 24-slot 14-pole machine to reduce the significant 1st sub-harmonic will be presented for machines with single-layer (SL) windings. From this, a novel double layer (DL) winding layout using the stator-shifting concept will be introduced. By adopting two SL winding sets with a 105\textdegree{} mechanical angle shift with respect to each other, it is not necessary to use overlapping windings. With this configuration, the 1st subharmonic will be completely cancelled and the parasitic 5th harmonic will be significantly reduced. Hence, the rotor losses, specifically magnet loss will be significantly reduced. Finally, two PM machines with different DL winding layout, namely, conventional 12-slot 14-pole and 24-slot 14-pole machine, will be designed and compared to validate the advantages of this winding topology.},
