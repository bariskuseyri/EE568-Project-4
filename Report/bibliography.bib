The machine was designed with large pole numbers suitable for low speed application such as direct drive wind turbine. The paper also presents a comprehensive comparison of performances between distributed and concentrated windings stator in a low speed IPMM. The various steps taken to minimize the cogging torque and torque ripple in the studied IPMMs are discussed in details.},

  abstract = {Several techniques may be adopted in designing surface-mounted permanent-magnet motors in order to reduce the cogging torque. This paper describes various classical and innovative techniques, giving a theoretical justification for each of them. To this aim, a simple original model of the cogging torque mechanism and a Fourier analysis are introduced. As a result, it is highlighted that some techniques are not always utilizable, and some of them may even be deprecatory when not used correctly. In addition, effects of cogging torque elimination on back electromotive force are discussed.},

  abstract = {Nowadays fractional-slot windings are proposed for synchronous motors for different purposes: reduction of end-winding losses, reduction of torque ripple, reduction of mutual coupling among the phases, fault-tolerant applications, and so on. The design of the single-layer fractionalslot synchronous motors is dealt with, in which each slot contains only one side coil. The star of slots, introduced some time ago, proves itself to be again appropriate. After a brief review of the classical theory of the star of slots, its application is extended to the design of these unconventional windings. Thanks to its graphical representation, a simple analytical formulation is carried out describing the harmonic contents of the winding distribution. Finally, the star of slots allows simple rules for the design of fractional-slot single-layer windings to be determined. As a special case, it is used to determine the synchronous motor winding solutions suitable for critical fault-tolerant applications.},

In the first part of the book the general theory governing the design of an electrical machine is presented; addressing the necessary fundamentals of electromagnetic theory; exploring possible winding arrangements and resistances; describing the behaviour of the magnetic circuit and flux leakage. After this introduction of principles the main body of the book focuses on the design of a rotating electrical machine. The book defines basic characteristics such as machine type (e.g. synchronous, asynchronous, DC and doubly salient reluctance machines) and type of construction (e.g. external pole, internal pole, axial flux and radial flux machines). It then moves on to provide a detailed analysis of the design process and properties of rotating electrical machines including the insulation and heat removal options. The book illustrates the necessary analytical calculations for machine design through direct design examples i.e. a permanent magnet motor for normal speeds with rotor surface magnets, traditional squirrel cage induction motor, a low speed high torque fractional slot permanent magnet motor etc. "-- "This book is an in-depth essential reference of rotating electrical machine design theory and application"--},

It is shown that the slot and pole number combination has a significant effect on the cogging torque, and influences the optimal value of both skew angle and magnet arc, as well as determining the optimal number of auxiliary teeth/slots. A simple factor, which is proportional to the slot number and the pole number and inversely proportional to their smallest common multiple, has been introduced to indicate the ``goodness'' of the slot and pole number combination. In general, the higher the ``goodness'' factor the larger the cogging torque.},

It is found that the influence of eccentricity reduces significantly with the number of structure cyclic symmetry, which is equal to the greatest common divisor of slot and pole numbers. Hence, the eccentricity shows the largest influence in machines having 2p = Ns {$\pm$} 1, small influence in machines having 2p = Ns {$\pm$} 2, and the smallest influence in the other machines. The static and rotating eccentricities result in cogging torque components multiples of (2p)th and (Ns)th orders, respectively. Both static and rotating eccentricities produce similar cogging torque magnitude. The experimental results validate the FE and analytical investigation.},
