	abstract = {Abstract This chapter overviews various permanent magnet (PM) brushless machines for traction applications. PM brushless DC and AC machines and drives are firstly compared in terms of constant torque and constant power capabilities, and their controllability. Various stator winding configurations, rotor topologies, and basic and novel machine topologies, including fractional slot PM, stator PM, and variable flux PM machines, as well as their features are highlighted. Then, alternate methods for enhancing the PM excitation torque and reluctance torque components, and thereby improving the torque and power capability, are described, together with methods for reducing the torque ripples and improving the overload, flux weakening, fault-tolerant, and demagnetization withstand capabilities.}

abstract = {Summary In Chapter 6, the main dimensions of rotating machines and their mutual relationships are discussed from the point of view of the design procedure. Basic features of the machines, their operational characteristics, ratings, and free parameters are defined as a basis for commencing the machine design. Some empirical information related to the selection of machine parameters aiming at an optimal solution, concerning flux densities, current densities, linear current densities, tangential stress, machine constant, weight, mechanical stress, and the like, are given in tables. Mechanical, electrical, and magnetic loadability are discussed. The length of air gap is given based on the field current linkage and armature reaction comparison, as well as on some empirical expressions. Some examples are elaborated to employ the given expressions.}

  abstract={In general, PM machines with conventional integer slot distributed winding (ISDW) schemes exhibit significant cogging torque resulting in high torque ripple which makes them unsuitable for EV applications which require low torque pulsations. This paper presents detailed analysis of the performance of PM Synchronous motor (PMSM) with fractional slot distributed winding (FSDW) scheme which shows significant reduction in torque ripple compared ISDW PM machines. Effect of the fractional slot winding distribution on electromagnetic torque pulsations has been analysed using Finite element (FE) computation technique. For a fair quantitative comparison between the above machine types, a flexible optimisation approach is proposed in this paper which generates Pareto fronts of the individual machine types.},
